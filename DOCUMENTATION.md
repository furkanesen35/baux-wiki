Baux Wiki is a self-hosted document management system designed for companies to organize and share internal knowledge. Similar to popular tools like Notion or Confluence, it allows teams to create, organize, and collaborate on documentation in a centralized platform.

## Overview

Baux Wiki provides a simple yet powerful interface for creating and managing company documentation. Users can create pages, organize them into hierarchies, format text, and search through all content. The system is designed to be intuitive for non-technical users while providing robust features for comprehensive documentation management.

## Key Features

**Page Organization**
Users can create unlimited pages and organize them into nested structures. Each page can contain multiple subpages, allowing for logical grouping of related information. The sidebar displays a tree view where users can expand and collapse sections to navigate the documentation hierarchy.

**Text Editing**
The editor provides familiar formatting options including bold, italic, and underline. Text can be highlighted in 10 different colors to emphasize important information. When text is selected, a floating toolbar appears with formatting options, similar to modern word processors.

**Search and Navigation**
A built-in search function allows users to quickly find pages by title or content. Pages can be linked to each other for easy cross-referencing, and clicking links automatically scrolls to the relevant section.

**File Attachments**
Users can upload and attach files directly to content blocks. Supported file types include images, PDFs, and other common document formats. Image and PDF previews are displayed directly in the page.

**Visual Themes**
The system supports both light and dark display modes, allowing users to choose their preferred reading environment.

## How It Works

The system stores all pages and content in a database, ensuring information is preserved and accessible. Pages are organized in a hierarchical structure, with each page potentially containing multiple subpages at any depth. Content within pages is organized into blocks, making it easy to add, edit, and rearrange information.

When users create or edit content, changes are automatically saved to the database. The search function indexes all page titles and content, providing fast results across the entire documentation library.

## Use Cases

Baux Wiki is suitable for various internal documentation needs:
- Company policies and procedures
- Project documentation and specifications
- Meeting notes and decisions
- Knowledge base articles
- Onboarding materials for new employees
- Team wikis and collaborative documentation

## Technical Information

The system is built with modern web technologies and runs on a local server, ensuring company data remains private and secure. It uses a PostgreSQL database for reliable data storage and can be accessed through any web browser on the company network.
